A "Retriever" component is responsible for managing various retrieval-related tasks. Its primary purpose is to retrieve the necessary information or resources required. Here's a breakdown of the responsibilities typically associated with a Retriever.

**Getting the Context**: The retriever is responsible for querying and retrieving data from the Vector database that stores the source data. This step will basically return the similar documents from source data based on the query.

**Post-processing**: After retrieving relevant documentation from vectordb, the Retriever will perform post-processing tasks on it. This will include parsing and may also include cleaning, formatting, or transforming the retrieved data to make it suitable for further use.

**Getting Prompt Templates**: Prompt templates are predefined and also can be dynamic structures that guide the conversation or interaction with the user. The Retriever will retrieve these templates from the prompt engine component.

There are three different types of prompt template available, you can look more into how the prompt engine component decides which prompt template should be used.

**Formatting the Prompt Template**: Once the prompt template is retrieved, the Retriever will be responsible for formatting it to ensure it aligns with the expected format.

**Getting the Chat History**: The chat history includes a record of previous interactions and messages exchanged within the conversation. The Retriever will retrieve previous chat history for the prompt template and also stores the latest chat conversation to the memory to maintain a sense of continuity and context within the conversation.

**Querying the Language Model (LLM)**: To generate responses, the Retriever interacts with a language model (LLM). It sends a prompt template to the LLM, which could involve asking questions, requesting responses, or seeking information based on the retrieved context and templates.

```py
class BaseRetrieverConfigModel(BaseModel):
    """
    Data Model for the configs
    """
    pass


class BaseRetrieverConfig(StackComponentConfig):
    data_model = BaseRetrieverConfigModel


class BaseRetriever(StackComponent):
    config_class = BaseRetrieverConfig

    def get_prompt(self, query:str):
        """
        This method returns the prompt template from the prompt engine component
        """
        return self.mediator.get_prompt_template(query)

    def retrieve(self, query:str) -> dict:
        """
        This method returns the model response for the prompt template.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def get_context(self, query:str):
        """
        This method returns the relevant documents returned by the similarity search
        from a vectordb based on the query
        """
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def get_chat_history(self) -> str:
        """
        This method returns the chat conversation history
        """
        return self.mediator.get_chat_history()
```

As you can see in the BaseRetriever interface, we have four retrievers and each one has their own responsibilities as mentioned in the start.
