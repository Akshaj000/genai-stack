### Requirements

-   Python environment with necessary packages installed.
-   GenAI Stack library and its dependencies.
-   Weaviate, an open-source vector search engine, installed and
    configured if it is used as the underlying VectorDB.
-   A dataset or source documents for indexing and searching.


``` python
from genai_stack.embedding.langchain import LangchainEmbedding[doc-search.ipynb](doc-search.ipynb)
from genai_stack.etl.langchain import LangchainETL
from genai_stack.stack.stack import Stack
from genai_stack.vectordb import ChromaDB
from genai_stack.vectordb.weaviate_db import Weaviate
```

## Search single document

Search a single document using etl and vector database.

``` python
embedding = LangchainEmbedding.from_kwargs(
    name="HuggingFaceEmbeddings",
    fields={
        "model_name": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",
        "model_kwargs": {"device": "cpu"},
        "encode_kwargs": {"normalize_embeddings": False},
    }
)
chromadb = ChromaDB.from_kwargs()
etl = LangchainETL.from_kwargs(
    name="PyPDFLoader", fields={
        "file_path": "<your_file>.pdf",
    }
)
stack = Stack(
    model=None,
    embedding=embedding,
    vectordb=chromadb,
    etl=etl
)
```

``` python
doc = chromadb.similarity_search("Who provide technical assistance to computer system users?")
```

``` python
for i in doc:
    print(i.metadata)
```
output
```
{'page': 2, 'source': '/home/akshaj/Documents/AIPlanet/DocumentSearch/data/2A2C2V4WI5YRDJHR26XUD4IAULIYGTMA.pdf'}
{'page': 2, 'source': '/home/akshaj/Documents/AIPlanet/DocumentSearch/data/2A2C2V4WI5YRDJHR26XUD4IAULIYGTMA.pdf'}
{'page': 2, 'source': '/home/akshaj/Documents/AIPlanet/DocumentSearch/data/2A2C2V4WI5YRDJHR26XUD4IAULIYGTMA.pdf'}
{'page': 1, 'source': '/home/akshaj/Documents/AIPlanet/DocumentSearch/data/2A2C2V4WI5YRDJHR26XUD4IAULIYGTMA.pdf'}
```
## Search multiple documents

Search a directory containing documents. Returns a list of documents
with path and page number.

``` python
embedding = LangchainEmbedding.from_kwargs(
    name="HuggingFaceEmbeddings",
    fields={
        "model_name": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",
        "model_kwargs": {"device": "cpu"},
        "encode_kwargs": {"normalize_embeddings": False},
    }
)
db = Weaviate.from_kwargs(
    url="http://localhost:8080/",
    index_name="Testing",
    text_key="test",
    attributes=["source", "page"]
)
```

``` python
file_folder = "<your_file_directory>"
```

``` python
import os
os.listdir(file_folder)
```
output
```
